# YOGI.SENSE

_**A connected wheelchair to enable wheelchair users to exercise through a yoga guided session.**_

## Concept description

Sitting in a wheelchair during long periods might increase problems of posture, blood circulation, and stiffness in the usersâ€™ body. There are so many reasons why yoga can be considered as a therapy for this kind of users, not to mention that it brings together mind and body, increasing well being in general. With this concept, posture is improved through different exercises which can also be considered as healing to joints and muscles avoiding stiffness and increasing blood circulation for wheelchair users. Furthermore, it must be noted that this practice link exercises with respiration, which will not just increase flexibility but also lung capacity.

> This connected wheelchair guides the user through different yoga postures using nine FSR distributed along the seat and backrest; they sense the position of the user, this data is collected making possible a recognition of the different postures the user performs. This way the user will be provided by feedback depending on the prediction made by machine learning.
