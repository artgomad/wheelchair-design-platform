### Current situation

Sitting in a wheelchair during long periods might increase problems of posture, blood circulation, and stiffness in the usersâ€™ body. There are so many reasons why yoga can be considered as a therapy for this kind of users, not to mention that it brings together mind and body, increasing well being in general. With this concept, posture is improved through different exercises which can also be considered as healing to joints and muscles avoiding stiffness and increasing blood circulation for wheelchair users. Furthermore, it must be noted that this practice link exercises with respiration, which will not just increase flexibility but also lung capacity.

### Concept description

This connected wheelchair guides the user through different yoga postures using nine FSR distributed along the seat and backrest; they sense the position of the user, this data is collected making possible a recognition of the different postures the user performs. This way the user will be provided by feedback depending on the prediction made by machine learning.

# Developing Connected Products and Services for the internet of Things

Wheelchair Design Platform is a repository that contains some resources to help
designers and developers speak the same language, and work together towards
addressing relevant challenges for wheelchair users. It is a collection of
workshop materials, code examples and also a compilation of resources to foster
a prospering research and design community around wheelchair users.

## Workshops

* [Getting started](/docs/workshops/GettingStarted.md)
* [Workshop 1: Building an Internet-Connected Wheelchair](/docs/workshops/Workshop1.md)
* [Workshop 2: Integrating and Visualising Sensor-Based Data](/docs/workshops/Workshop2.md)
* [Workshop 3: Developing Algorithms and Controlling Actuators](/docs/workshops/Workshop3.md)
* [Workshop 4: Developing and Conducting a Data Collection Campaign](/docs/workshops/Workshop4.md)
* [Workshop 5: Implementing a Machine Learning Pipeline](/docs/workshops/Workshop5.md)
* [Workshop 6: Developing a Product Analytics Dashboard](/docs/workshops/Workshop6.md)

## Resources

* This platform uses two programming languages, Python on computers and C on
micro-controllers. While descriptions and examples of code should help you
get started, you can find some additional resources
[here](/docs/resources/software.md "Python and C resources").

* Documentation of your project is key,
[here are some tips and examples](/docs/resources/documentation.md "Documentation tips and examples").

* [Git manipulation such as Pull Request](/docs/resources/git.md "Git manipulation").
