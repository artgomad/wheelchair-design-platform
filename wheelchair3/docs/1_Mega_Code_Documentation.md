# Arduino Mega:

**Code Name:** Input_FSR_to_Serial_MEGA.ino

This code reads the values of 9 FSR sensors and prints them in the Serial port. It also transforms the readings of a button into a switch variable, switching from true to false whenever the button is pressed.

The 9 FSR values and the switch value are printed in the Serial port in a single line. The 9 values are separated by comas among each other, and a ',B,' separates them from the switch value, which comes last in the line.
